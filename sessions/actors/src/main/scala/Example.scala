// Plan
// Goal: we can send a message to an ActorRef from an ActorSystem in one process
// and have that message get executed by an Actor that is running on an ActorSystem
// in another process
// And do this in a way where we can convince ourselves that if those processes were
// on different machines, it would still work
// 1. Introduce concept of an ActorId
//    - Location - host and port of the ActorSystem where this actor is physically located
//    - Id       - unique identifier within a physical instantiation of an ActorSystem
//    (Location + Id) uniquely identify an actor // localhost:8080/1, localhost:8080/2, localhost:8081/1
// 2. Each time we start an ActorSystem in a process we also start a server that corresponds to that ActorSystem
// 3. When we send a message to an ActorRef associated with an ActorSystem, we do the following:
//    A. We check whether the location of the actor is on our machine
//    B. If so, run it as before
//    C. If not, forward the request to the server that corresponds to that ActorSystem and either wait
//       or not depending on if it is a ask or tell
// 4. Hypothesis is use ZIO HTTP to implement the server
// 5. Will need to deal with serialization and deserialization of messages, will probably use ZIO Schema
